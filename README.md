# jsystemd

This project contains modules to integrate Java services with systemd.

It aims primarily to provide decent integration of services developed with Spring Boot, but
may contain interesting and reusable components for other projects.

## How to use

When using Spring Boot, simply import the `com.github.jpmsilva.jsystemd:systemd-spring-boot-starter`
dependency into your own project.
